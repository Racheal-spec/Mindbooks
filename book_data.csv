She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.A GAME OF THRONESLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.source: georgerrmartin.com","language":"English","isbn":"9780553588484","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Dragons', 'Audiobook', 'Epic']","characters":"['Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Tyrion Lannister', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Eddard Stark', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Robb Stark', 'Arya Stark', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Varys', 'Hodor', 'Beric Dondarrion', 'Thoros of Myr', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Grenn', 'Mace Tyrell', 'Septa Mordane', 'Jon Snow', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Jorah Mormont']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"","pages":"835","publisher":"Bantam","publishDate":"08/28/05","firstPublishDate":"08/06/96","awards":"['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1997)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)', 'Premio Ignotus for Novela extranjera (2003)']","numRatings":"2003043","ratingsByStars":"['1231600', '540493', '156705', '41880', '32365']","likedPercent":"96","setting":"['The Lands of Ice and Fire']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496.jpg","bbeScore":"562241","bbeVotes":"6007","price":"4.01"},{"bookId":"136251.Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows","title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","series":"Harry Potter #7","author":"J.K.

A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com","language":"English","isbn":"9780439655484","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Adventure', 'Middle Grade', 'Audiobook', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']","characters":"['Sirius Black', 'Draco Malfoy', 'Ron Weasley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley', 'Dudley Dursley', 'Severus Snape', 'Rubeus Hagrid', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Neville Longbottom', 'Fred Weasley', 'George Weasley', 'Percy Weasley', 'Ginny Weasley', 'Colin Creevey', 'Filius Flitwick', 'Pomona Sprout', 'Arthur Weasley', 'Molly Weasley', 'Cho Chang', 'Marjorie Dursley', 'Cornelius Fudge', 'Remus Lupin', 'Sybil Trelawney', 'Peter Pettigrew', 'Poppy Pomfrey', 'Stan Shunpike', 'Oliver Wood', 'Cedric Diggory', 'Dean Thomas', 'Seamus Finnigan', 'Rolanda Hooch', 'Katie Bell', 'Ernie Prang', 'Albus Dumbledore', 'Harry Potter', 'Hermione Granger']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"","pages":"435","publisher":"Scholastic Inc.","publishDate":"05/01/04","firstPublishDate":"07/08/99","awards":"['Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers (1999)', 'Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (2000)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2000)', \"Whitbread Award for Children's Book of the Year (1999)\", \"Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature (2008)\", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2005)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2004)', 'Maine Student Book Award (2001)', 'Golden Archer Award for Intermediate (2001)', 'Indian Paintbrush Book Award (2004)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2002)', 'Hotze de Roosprijs (2001)', 'Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for 9–11 years (1999)']","numRatings":"2806471","ratingsByStars":"['1892635', '668920', '205266', '27227', '12423']","likedPercent":"99","setting":"['Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (United Kingdom)', 'London, England']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499277281l/5.jpg","bbeScore":"247736","bbeVotes":"2770","price":"5.94"},{"bookId":"6.Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire","title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","series":"Harry Potter #4","author":"J.K.

The Saga of an American Family","series":"","author":"Alex Haley","rating":"4.43","description":"When he was a boy in Henning, Tennessee, Alex Haley's grandmother used to tell him stories about their family—stories that went back to her grandparents, and their grandparents, down through the generations all the way to a man she called \"the African.\" She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the \"Kamby Bolongo\" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of \"the African\"—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.","language":"English","isbn":"9780440174646","genres":"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'African American', 'Africa', 'Race', 'Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Novels']","characters":"['George Lincoln Rockwell', 'Alex Haley', 'Kunta Kinte']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"","pages":"729","publisher":"Dell Publishing Company","publishDate":"01/01/77","firstPublishDate":"08/17/76","awards":"['ASJA Outstanding Book Award (1978)', 'Audie Award for Nonfiction (2008)', 'Premio Bancarella (1978)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (1976)', 'Lillian Smith Book Award (1977)']","numRatings":"146094","ratingsByStars":"['85617', '42483', '14464', '2384', '1146']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['United States of America', 'Gambia']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936l/546018.jpg","bbeScore":"50100","bbeVotes":"658","price":"3.1"},{"bookId":"188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes","title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","series":"Sherlock Holmes #1-9","author":"Arthur Conan Doyle","rating":"4.48","description":"A study in scarlet --The sign of four --Adventures of Sherlock Holmes : A scandal in Bohemia ; The red-headed league ; A case of identity ; The Boscombe Valley mystery ; The five orange pips ; The man with the twisted lip ; The adventure of the blue carbuncle ; The adventure of the speckled band ; The adventure of the engineer's thumb ; The adventure of the noble bachelor ; The adventure of the beryl coronet ; The adventure of the copper beeches --Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes : Silver blaze ; The yellow face ; The stock-broker's clerk ; The \"Gloria Scott\" ; The Musgrave ritual ; The Reigate puzzle ; The crooked man ; The resident patient ; The Greek interpreter ; The naval treaty ; The final problem --The return of Sherlock Holmes : The adventure of the empty house ; The adventure of the Norwood builder ; The adventure of the dancing men ; The adventure of the solitary cyclist ; The adventure of the priory school ; The adventure of Black Peter ; The adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton ; The adventure of the six Napoleons ; The adventure of the three students ; The adventure of the golden pince-nez ; The adventure of the missing three-quarter ; The adventure of the abbey grange ; The adventure of the second stain.

When he awoke from his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: Annabeth. HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her \"gift\" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart.Beginning at the \"other\" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.","language":"English","isbn":"9781423140597","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Greek Mythology', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy']","characters":"['Nico di Angelo', 'Octavian', 'Hera', 'Reyna', 'Juno', 'Hazel Levesque', 'Frank Zhang', 'Ella the Harpy', 'Percy Jackson']","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"First Edition","pages":"513","publisher":"Disney ● Hyperion Books","publishDate":"10/04/11","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[\"Buckeye Children's Book Award for 6-8 (2012)\", \"Goodreads Choice Award for Middle Grade & Children's and Nominee for Favorite Book (2011)\"]","numRatings":"412823","ratingsByStars":"['239125', '124167', '40367', '6527', '2637']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['Oakland, California (United States)', 'Alaska (United States)', 'Portland, Oregon (United States)', 'Seattle, Washington (United States)', 'Berkeley, California (United States)', 'North Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada)', 'Anchorage, Alaska (United States)', 'Seward, Alaska (United States)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464201114l/9520360._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":"37699","bbeVotes":"476","price":"6.42"},{"bookId":"33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings","title":"The Lord of the Rings","series":"The Lord of the Rings #1-3","author":"J.R.R.

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.","language":"English","isbn":"9999999999999","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Literature', 'High Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Young Adult']","characters":"['Frodo Baggins', 'Meriadoc Brandybuck', 'Peregrin Took', 'Gandalf', 'Aragorn', 'Gimli', 'Boromir', 'Bilbo Baggins', 'Treebeard', 'Saruman', 'Éowyn', 'Éomer', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Arwen Undómiel', 'Galadriel', 'Faramir', 'Gollum', 'Legolas', 'Sam Gamgee']","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"50th Anniversary One-volume Edition","pages":"1216","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","publishDate":"10/12/05","firstPublishDate":"10/20/55","awards":"['Hugo Award Nominee for Best All-Time Series (1966)', 'Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (2009)', 'International Fantasy Award for Fiction (1957)', 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2002)', 'Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger for Roman (1972)', 'Nynorsk litteraturpris (2006)']","numRatings":"564734","ratingsByStars":"['369046', '131547', '45691', '11983', '6467']","likedPercent":"97","setting":"['Middle-earth']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566425108l/33.jpg","bbeScore":"34216","bbeVotes":"410","price":""},{"bookId":"12127750-the-mark-of-athena","title":"The Mark of Athena","series":"The Heroes of Olympus #3","author":"Rick Riordan (Goodreads Author)","rating":"4.45","description":"Annabeth is terrified. Just when she's about to be reunited with Percy—after six months of being apart, thanks to Hera—it looks like Camp Jupiter is preparing for war. As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the Argo II, she can't blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon figurehead, Leo's fantastical creation doesn't appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.And that's only one of her worries. In her pocket, Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving command: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to find—and close—the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?Annabeth's biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he's now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader—but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her sideNarrated by four different demigods, The Mark of Athena is an unforgettable journey across land and sea to Rome, where important discoveries, surprising sacrifices, and unspeakable horrors await.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.","language":"English","isbn":"9780765326355","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","characters":"['Kaladin Stormblessed', 'Dalinar Kholin', 'Shallan Davar', 'Jasnah Kholin', 'Adolin Kholin', 'Hoid']","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":"1007","publisher":"Tor Books","publishDate":"08/31/10","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'Whitney Award for Best Novel (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author (2010)']","numRatings":"302877","ratingsByStars":"['221465', '60345', '14100', '4101', '2866']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['Roshar']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg","bbeScore":"34012","bbeVotes":"359","price":"22.74"},{"bookId":"11387515-wonder","title":"Wonder","series":"Wonder #1","author":"R.J.

Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.

She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gaëtan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.","language":"English","isbn":"9780312577223","genres":"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'France', 'Adult Fiction', 'Romance']","characters":"['Vianne Mauriac', 'Isabelle Rossignol']","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":"440","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","publishDate":"02/03/15","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"['Audie Award for Fiction (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Historical Fiction (2015) and Nominee for Best of the Best  (2018)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2017)']","numRatings":"697799","ratingsByStars":"['478549', '162598', '40635', '10226', '5791']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['Paris (France)', 'Loire Valley (France)', 'Pyrenees', 'Oregon Coast (United States)', 'Carriveau (France)', 'Portland, Oregon (United States)', 'Ravensbrück (Germany)', 'Paris (France)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598993363l/21853621._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":"10473","bbeVotes":"121","price":"4.7"},{"bookId":"28260587-empire-of-storms","title":"Empire of Storms","series":"Throne of Glass #5","author":"Sarah J.

She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it.

When his brother is arrested, he must descend into the Kafkaesque world of the Ottoman authorities in his search to discover what happened to him.

In time, he begins to question his relations with society as a whole and, eventually, his life choices in general.

Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, Homegoing heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. Homegoing is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.","language":"English","isbn":"9781101947135","genres":"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Race', 'Adult Fiction', 'Ghana']","characters":"['Cobbe Otcher', 'Effia Otcher', 'Big Man Assare', 'Esi Assare', 'Quey Collins', 'Richard Collins', 'Ness Stockham', 'Sam', 'James Richard Collins', 'Akosua Mensah', 'Kojo Freeman', 'Anna Foster', 'Abena Collins', 'Ohene Nyarko', 'H Black', 'Ethe Jackson', 'Akua Collins', 'Asamoah Agyekum', 'Eli Dalton', 'Willie Black', 'Robert Clifton', 'Yaw Agyekum', 'Esther Amoah', 'Carson Clifton', 'Amani Zulema', 'Marjorie Agyekum', 'Marcus Clifton', 'Maame']","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":"320","publisher":"Alfred A.

Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D.

The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife.A Land Remembered was winner of the Florida Historical Society's Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel.

One of them will destroy us.","language":"English","isbn":"9780765365279","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","characters":"['Kaladin Stormblessed', 'Dalinar Kholin', 'Shallan Davar', 'Jasnah Kholin', 'Adolin Kholin', 'Hoid']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"","pages":"1258","publisher":"Tom Doherty","publishDate":"May 24th 2011","firstPublishDate":"08/31/10","awards":"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'Whitney Award for Best Novel (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author (2010)']","numRatings":"303454","ratingsByStars":"['221838', '60468', '14141', '4119', '2888']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['Roshar']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436456720l/9647295._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":"100","bbeVotes":"1","price":"8.57"},{"bookId":"31925314-beard-science","title":"Beard Science","series":"Winston Brothers #3","author":"Penny Reid (Goodreads Author)","rating":"4.44","description":"\n  Make a deal with the devil and you might get what you want, but will it be what you need? \n  Jennifer Sylvester wants one thing, and that one thing is NOT to be Tennessee’s reigning Banana Cake Queen.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.","language":"English","isbn":"9780765326355","genres":"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","characters":"['Kaladin Stormblessed', 'Dalinar Kholin', 'Shallan Davar', 'Jasnah Kholin', 'Adolin Kholin', 'Hoid']","bookFormat":"Kindle Edition","edition":"","pages":"1137","publisher":"Tor Books","publishDate":"August 31st 2010","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2011)', 'Whitney Award for Best Novel (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author (2010)']","numRatings":"304529","ratingsByStars":"['222482', '60729', '14210', '4177', '2931']","likedPercent":"98","setting":"['Roshar']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1296253603l/9188338._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":"93","bbeVotes":"1","price":"22.47"},{"bookId":"17333174-magic-binds","title":"Magic Binds","series":"Kate Daniels #9","author":"Ilona Andrews (Goodreads Author)","rating":"4.55","description":"Mercenary Kate Daniels knows all too well that magic in post-Shift Atlanta is a dangerous business.
